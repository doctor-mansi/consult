                A 13-year-old male presented to the clinic with a concerning array of dermatological issues. For the past week, 
                he had developed noticeable white spots on his face, accompanied by an eruption of lesions across his hands and trunk. 
                Adding to these recent complaints was a persistent, palpable knot behind his left ear, which had been present for 
                3-4 years. A thorough physical examination was conducted, leading to a targeted treatment plan. Within a week, 
                the patient showed remarkable improvement. His white spots faded, skin eruptions resolved, and the knot 
                behind his ear started reducing in size.

            <p class="full-story">
                On December 14th, 2024, a 50-year-old female presented with a complex constellation of symptoms. She had 
                pigmentation on her forehead, cheeks, and nose, along with hair loss, headaches, and allergies. A holistic approach 
                was adopted, addressing both physical and emotional concerns. Within a week, her mental state improved, 
                headaches subsided, and pigmentation started fading. Over three months, she experienced significant healing, 
                with reduced pigmentation, stabilized hair loss, and complete resolution of her headaches.
